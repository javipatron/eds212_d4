## Leslie matrix example

Model population changes using the same example we did in lecture.

```{r}

vector_leslie <- c(0,0,600,0.2,0,0,0,0.08,0)
insect_leslie <- matrix(data=vector_leslie, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
insect_leslie

```

## Adding inicial conditions

```{r}
ini_vector <- c(12000, 700, 500)

```


```{r}
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% ini_vector

insect_y1
```

Estimate populations at each life stage at year 2 and year 3


```{r}

insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1
insect_y2
insect_y3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y2
insect_y3
```
